			<p>V's character design isn't my favorite but her character devlopment is my favorite out of every character. She goes from sadistic murderer to someone who truly cares about the people shes around. My favorite moment from the series is when she would sacrifice herself to the setiniels (robo raptors) in order to save her friends. Her whole character changes from even episode 2-3 where she begins to feel bad for her Co-worker N as she realizes that he cares for Uzi. Overall, great character in the series and love the way she looks out for both Uzi and N during the end. </p>
