			<p>Cynessa,"cyn" or The absolute solver, has the best design out of everyone in the series. The amount of time and effort it took for them to render the model took a good TWO YEARS (from one of the images from the discord). Cynessa is the main antagonist throughout the plot and does a good job at showing the full horror of the series. I love the fact that she would use her caretakers body as a skinsuit in order to fool her "friends". She's the same drone (robot) that caused the mass extinction of the human race and would erase her friends memory in order for them to continue serving her. Overall, cyn is such a cool and sadistic character that makes Murder Drones complete Cynema. </p>
