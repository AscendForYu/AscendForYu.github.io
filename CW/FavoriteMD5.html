			<p>I love N's design. N's truly a wholesome character despite his past. He'd look out for anyone even if his job would punish for it. Throughout the series he grows to be alittle too attached to uzi to the point where he'd threaten the people looking out for him for this one drone that posed a danger to their very own planet. I ranked N 4th because honestly, I liked the other characters alittle more but N is still one of my favorites regardless.</p>
