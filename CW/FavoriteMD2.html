			<p>J is honestly my favorite character design from the whole series. She has such a simplistic design that works so well with the workaholic personality that is given with the character. Her chacter development is pretty odd as throughout the whole series she doesn't really change at all and doesn't get a chance to show growth due to the short runtime of each episode (20 minute runtime). It was shown that her voice actor had more linese in a sponsor than all the main episodes as a whole (There's 8 episodes in total).  </p>
