		<p>Uzi is probably the most relatable character of the series for me. Shes always reminds me of the actions I regret doing as her character is described to be an "Angsty teen". She goes through her rebelious phaese as a main character well and shows to embrace cringe, even if it was in your childhood. Never regret your downs or ups and keep on going in order to suceed. Uzi has shown time and time again that the people shes around boosts her as a person. If it weren't for her friends, she probably wouldn't be alive during the series... Character design wise, she has such a simplistic design and its very enjoyable to look at but I do enjoy her solver form alot more.</p>
